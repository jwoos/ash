# Another Shell
This is simply another shell built in order to learn C and the workings of a shell.

## Features

### Builtins
- pwd
- cd
- exit

More to come soon.

### Execute
It currently can handle any command with as many arguments as you want! It does not yet support piping, redirecting or any kind of shell specific functions.

## Build
To build, simply run `make`. This should build the `ash` binary. Run it with `./ash`

## Test
There is currently no testing suite - unless you count manual interactions!
